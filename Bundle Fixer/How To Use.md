# Q: How I use it

**A**: Download Bundle Fixer adapted your Python version w/ hashlist from [payday2-hashlist](https://bitbucket.org/Frankelstner/pd2-hashlist). Run `Python x.x.py` and check `all_h.bundle` is existed. Then, put hashlist into the folder Bundle Modder existed, run Bundle Modder, and extract.
